# AI Automation Integration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to integrate AI automation into the Give-A-Wonderful-Day platform, focusing on:
- Grant application automation
- Donor engagement
- Impact reporting

## Steps
1. **Grant Application Automation**
   - Use AI to scrape, summarize, and auto-fill grant applications.
   - Integrate with web3 to submit on-chain proof of applications.

2. **Donor Engagement Bots**
   - Personalize communications using AI (emails, social, newsletters).
   - Automate follow-ups and campaign launches.

3. **Impact Reporting**
   - Use AI to analyze on-chain and off-chain data.
   - Auto-generate reports for donors and the public.

## Next Actions
- Select AI frameworks (best free/open-source options):
  - **Grant Application Automation**: Use [LangChain.js](https://js.langchain.com/) with [HuggingFace Inference API](https://huggingface.co/inference-api) (free tier) or [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) for free/low-cost LLMs. For local inference, use [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) or [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) with open models (e.g., Mistral, Llama 2).
  - **Donor Engagement Bots**: Use [LangChain.js] for prompt orchestration and [HuggingFace Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) for local or free-tier text generation. For email, use [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/) (free, local SMTP).
  - **Impact Reporting**: Use [LangChain.js] for summarization and [HuggingFace Transformers] for local summarization models (e.g., bart-large-cnn, t5-small).
- Build API endpoints for automation (already scaffolded in `/app/api/ai/`).
- Pause here: Backend structure is ready for integration with selected frameworks. Confirm before proceeding to frontend integration and compliance steps.
